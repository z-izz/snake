# snake
  
A simple snake game written in Ruby with Gosu, with free-movement, some optimization, and more.

## Features

- it's snake
- it's not on a grid like normal snake games, it's a free-movement system.
- Some optimization, only draws as many triangles as allowed by the `config.ini`
- INI Parser
- Kind-of obfuscated high score system (it's bad)
- Settings (only 1 setting)
- "AI" that plays on the title screen (not really AI, just a bot)

## Running

- Install Ruby.
- Install Gosu by typing `gem install gosu`
- Run the game
